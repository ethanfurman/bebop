Synopsis
========

*bebop* is a cataloging music player.  It's important distinctions are:

- random mode:  it makes sure that every song is played in a list before any song is repeated
  (with some adjustments for favorites) -- after all, if have a song in a list you want to hear
  it, right?

- *playlist*/*genre*: playlists and genres are tracked by tag -- *country* and *upbeat* would
  both be tags, and both selectable as playlists

- favorites: each song has a favorites rating *by tag* -- meaning a song can have a high
  rating in one tag (and be played more often there) and a low rating in a different tag (so
  it's not played as often when that tag is selected)
